# MySQLConnectorWrapper-for-Robotframework
A simple to use MSQL Connector Wrap to be imported into Robotframework

Simply install MysqlConnector for python on your system, put the wrapper file into a directory used by RobotFramework and import it with a Library statement.

Note that current version of Mysqlconnector will fail on Python 2.7 due to the heavy use of f strings in a few of the modules. So you need to have your RobotFramework environment setup to use Python 3.

I developed this on my free time, but feel free to make improvement suggestion, report bugs, and any thoughts on it.

Regards to all
Andre
